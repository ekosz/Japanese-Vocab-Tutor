Japanese Vocab Tutor
--------------------

Tired of all of the bloat of other Japanese tutoring software?  Wish there was
just an easier way to learn in the terminal?

Well now you can!

Using this software, you can study vocabulary for all 5 of the JLPT tests.

How to Install
--------------

1. Clone this project
2. `ruby main.rb`
3. Enjoy!

Its that simple

Web Version
-----------

I like this project so much I decided to make it into a Web App.  You can get
it at the Google [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ldemblkooloonmjfiainhkhmmlelfnfb).


Closing thoughts
---------------
 
This is the simplest piece of software possible for studying for the JLPT.  It
currently **does not** remember any of your correct / wrong attempt.  Though
this can can be added without too much difficultly.  In fact, I might add that
in the future.
